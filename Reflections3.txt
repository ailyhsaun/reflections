This is not a refleciton persay but I decided to post the URL for my new repository to my notes.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A good example of when this is useful is if you are working from a different computer (like at school) or if someone else is adding to the repository during a collaboration. Either would be a good time to use the remote feature.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When pushing, you want to do it manually so that something is not "published" prematurely, the same is true for pulls. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- clones just copy a repository onto a local machine
- fork creates a copy of the repository (like clone) but on github and it links back to it's original coder (LarryMad)
- branches are within a repository, and are seperately to "cloud' like Github
