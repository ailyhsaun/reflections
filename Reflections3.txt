Lesson 4 - Video 5
This is not a refleciton persay but I decided to post the URL for my new repository to my notes.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A good example of when this is useful is if you are working from a different computer (like at school) or if someone else is adding to the repository during a collaboration. Either would be a good time to use the remote feature.
